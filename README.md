# <Module-9-ReadME-File-Maker>

## Description

This project was created to save managers time when creating a webpage to hold the information of seperate teams that they are in charge of. The webpage created displays all team members relavent information cleary while also hyperlinking github usernames and emails, making it that quicker and easier to review someones code or send them a message about an important update. In creating this project I leanred more about the possibilities of node in creating different files or applications based off of user input from a terminal.
