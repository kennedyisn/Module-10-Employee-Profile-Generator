# <Module-10-Employee-Profile-Generator>

## Description

This project was created to save managers time when creating a webpage to hold the information of seperate teams that they are in charge of. The webpage created displays all team members relavent information cleary while also hyperlinking github usernames and emails, making it that quicker and easier to review someones code or send them a message about an important update. In creating this project I leanred more about the possibilities of node in creating different files or applications based off of user input from a terminal.

## Installation

Before running this application you need to install "inquirer" and "fs" which can be done by typing "npm install inquirer" followed by "npm install fs" in the terminal. To run the tests for this application you must install jest as well, which can be done by typing "npm install jest" into your terminal.

## Usage

After installing required dependencies, open the terminal and type in "node index.js" to run the application. You will then be prompted questions that will be used to form your team managers profile, after that you will encounter a menu allowing you to create a new engineer profile, intern profile, or finish building your team and see your created team profile webpage. After youve created all the profiles for your team and selected the "finish building your team" option your profile page file will be generated and stored under the name "TeamProfile.HTML". The picture below shows a webpage made using the application and the styling included can be found in the "dist" folder.
